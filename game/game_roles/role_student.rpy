# All info related to the "Student" role

#Plan:
# 1) On your second(ish) visit to Nora you run into one of her students talking to Nora. Nora hurries her out.
# 1a) Add a way to connect with Nora even if you don't accept her help on serum. (ie. without Steph either)
# 2) Student needs help with class. Next time you visit she talks to you instead, asking "I know you've worked with Professor blah. Maybe you could help me."
# 3) Help the student study for Nora's classes, raising Love each time. Convince her to take serum to make her smarter.
# 4) Nora notices her student is doing better and mentions she's having trouble with her lectures. She "Can't keep the attention of the class."
# 5) Convince Nora she needs to "put on more of a show", starting with sexier outfits. Eventually have Nora letting students fuck her as a reward for doing well.
# 6) Convince student to try more and more slutty things as either a reward or punishment for her performance.
